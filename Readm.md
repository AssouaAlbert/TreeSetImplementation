Use Cases of TreeSet
Sorted Collection: When you need a collection that maintains elements in a sorted order, a TreeSet is ideal. For example, maintaining a list of words sorted alphabetically.

Range Operations: TreeSet allows for efficient range operations like subSet, headSet, and tailSet, which are useful in scenarios where you need to perform operations within a specific range of elements.

Unique Elements: Similar to HashSet, TreeSet ensures that there are no duplicate elements. This is useful for scenarios where uniqueness is required along with natural ordering, such as storing unique user IDs in a sorted manner.

Navigation Methods: TreeSet provides navigation methods like pollFirst, pollLast, ceiling, floor, higher, and lower, which can be useful for applications that require frequent access to the closest matches or bounded values.

Complex Sorting: When dealing with objects that need to be sorted based on multiple fields, you can define a custom comparator and use it with TreeSet to maintain the desired order. For example, sorting employees by their ID and name.
